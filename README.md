A credit risk classification which I test two models to determine which is more accurately catches high-risk loans in a dataset of lending information. To compare the two models results I use the accuracy score, confusion matrix, and classification report. Analyzing the most important metrics from these reports, the preicison and recall, I then make a recomendation in the attached Analysis report regarding which model to use.
